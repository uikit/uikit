      <h1>How to customize</h1>

      <p class="uk-article-lead">Create your own style with the customizer.</p>

      <p>UIkit comes with a <a href="customizer.html">customizer</a> that enables you to make adjustments to the theme you are using with just a few clicks and no need for any CSS knowledge. You can then download your new CSS and even the pending Less variables, all ready to use.</p>

      <p><span class="uk-badge">NOTE</span> To optimize performance, we recommend disabling add-ons, like Web Developer and Firebug in <em>Firefox</em>.</p>

      <h2 id="usage"><a href="#usage" class="uk-link-reset">Usage</a></h2>

      <p>Choose the theme that you would like to customize from the select box. Click inside a color square to open the dialog and change your color. To adjust a numeric value, like width or margin, just click in the text area and type your own value. You can even use a different unit and the customizer will recalculate automatically. Once you are satisfied with your adjustments, hit <em>Get CSS</em> to download your new theme and copy it into your UIkit <code>/css</code> folder.</p>

      <h3>Advanced mode</h3>

      <p>The variables within the customizer are separated into two main parts. First, variables which are displayed by default and variables which only appear in the <em>Advanced Mode</em>. The visible variables are often the global ones, because they usually define the value of component variables. To see the component variables, just check the Advanced mode box.</p>

      <h3>More</h3>

      <p>By default, variables whose value is defined through another variable are hidden. In Advanced mode you can see a <em>(More)</em> button next to groups that include these kinds of variables. This option is extremely powerful as it enables you to set your own value for any component variable.</p>

      <h3>Minified CSS</h3>

      <p>Check <em>Minify CSS</em> before downloading your theme, so UIkit removes all line breaks and unnecessary spaces from your CSS, reducing its file size considerably. </p>

      <h3>RTL</h3>

      <p>UIkit has the option of on the fly right-to-left language localization. All you need to do is check <em>RTL mode</em> and the whole theme will convert automatically.</p>

      <h3>Get Less</h3>

      <p>You can also download only the variables in one Less file to use them in your project.</p>
